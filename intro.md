# Introduction (you may want to pause the video)

This is a quick demonstration of the three prototype Legacy client pages (the main jumping off point for all functionality). Each choice will be preceded by a very short description. You may want to pause the video at those pages if you're having trouble reading it all before the video moves on. Then I will perform identical actions on all three. The client page will already be pulled up. I will select the POA Create or Set Up options (it's not completely consistent across all three), enter (or modify) the information, save it and then select the option to Generate a POA.
